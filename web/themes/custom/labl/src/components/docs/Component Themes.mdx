# Component Themes

We set the theme on a Component by applying a `data-bs-theme` attribute to the containing element, this usually being the `<section>` tag.
e.g.
```
<section class="testimonial" data-bs-theme="dark" >
  ... component code here ...
</section>
```

For the purposes of this default Design System we have 2 themes set up, light and dark, but it has been known for sites to have up to 8 different theme options,
which is why using the CSS variable approach to theming is the simplest and quickest way to add additional themes quickly.

By using CSS variable/Token for the values of styles it means we can dynamically change these values based on the theme set on the component, without requiring any additional classes or logic.

## Exporting Themed Tokens
The CSS2Variables plugin will group the CSS Variables in the correct groups for the light and dark themes as set in Figma by the designers.

You will however need to change the attribute from `[data-theme="Light"]` to `[data-bs-theme="light"]`

Making it lowercase and adding in the -bs namespace the the attribute.
It is also important to add `:root,`before the light theme declarations so this becomes the default theme used if no theme attribute is found on the component.
e.g.
```
:root, [data-bs-theme="light"] {
  /* color */
  --badge-default-solid-default-background-color: var(--theme-secondary-default);
  --badge-default-solid-default-border-color: var(--theme-secondary-default);
  ...
}
[data-bs-theme="dark"] {
  --badge-primary-solid-default-background-color: var(--color-violet-100);
  --badge-primary-solid-default-border-color: var(--color-violet-100);
  --badge-primary-solid-default-foreground-color: var(--color-violet-800);
  ...
}
```
